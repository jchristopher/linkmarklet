Linkmarklet is an alternative to the Press This! bookmarklet aimed at rapid link blogging.

== Description ==

Instead of the traditional Press This! interface, Linkmarklet offers a much more streamlined UI allowing you to linkblog quickly. Upon clicking the bookmarklet, Linkmarklet will present you with a simple way of editing the page title, the page link, the page slug, and the post content. In the settings you can define three things:

1. The category to which Linkmarklet posts will be added
2. The Custom Field name you're using to store the submitted link
3. The Post Format you would like to use for each post
4. Whether or not to Future Post the current post and by how many minutes compared to your future-most scheduled post

That's about it. Clicking Publish pushes the entry live instantly (or schedules it). Clicking Save will store the post as a Draft.

== Installation ==

1. Upload Linkmarklet to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== Changelog ==

= 0.4 =
* Support for Future Publishing. If you're like me, you like to bulk-linkblog, but you don't want to innundate readers with tons of posts all at once. There's now a setting that will let you auto-schedule a post to go live within a timeframe after your future-most-scheduled post. You can also set a 'bumper' of time between your most recently published posts.
* Added (optional) support for Tags

= 0.3 =
* Support for Post Formats

= 0.2 =
* Better handling of text input fields on mobile devices
* Option to auto-generate the slug (or not)
* Added 'Save' button to save as a Draft instead of Publish straight away

= 0.1 =
* Initial release
